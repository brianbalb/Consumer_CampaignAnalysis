📊 Customer Analytics Overview – Key Insights Summary
1. 🧮 Customer Spending Distribution
Insight:
The majority of customers fall into the low spending bracket, with a steep drop in count as spending increases.

~55% of customers spend less than $500

Very few customers cross the $2,000 threshold

Action recommended: 
Focus on upselling and loyalty programs to move mid-tier spenders upward. The current base is wide, but not deep in spend.

2. 💰 Income vs Total Spending by Customer Segment
Insight:
While income generally trends with spending, many high-income customers show lower engagement or spending.

High-income outliers don’t always translate to high spend

Engagement varies widely across all segments

Action recommended:
There’s an opportunity to re-target affluent low-spenders using tailored messaging or premium offerings.

3. 📦 Marketing Channel Effectiveness
Insight:
Store purchases lead with 46% of total transactions, followed by Web (32%) and Catalog (21%).

Store channel continues to outperform in volume

Catalog may be underperforming or niche

Action recommended:
Invest in enhancing the in-store experience, but don’t ignore digital — Web is second-strongest and may grow with better engagement or targeting.

4. ⏳ Recency vs Spending by Engagement and Segment
Insight:
High spenders are distributed across both recent and long-dormant customers.

Low-engagement high-spenders exist — representing churn risk

Some segments are active but have low spend

Action recommended: 
Implement win-back campaigns targeting lapsed high spenders, and re-engagement nudges for disengaged segments.

5. 📈 Customer Acquisition Timeline
Insight:
Customer acquisition is steady but not growing — the average monthly intake remains around 90–110 customers.

Peak months saw ~220 new customers (e.g., August)

Downtrends exist that may correspond to campaign performance

Stakeholder Implication:
Use this timeline to evaluate past marketing campaigns. Invest more during proven high-yield months or experiment during lower-performing ones.
