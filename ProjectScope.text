📌 1. Project Overview
This project builds a data-driven framework to evaluate and optimize media campaign performance. Using machine learning models, we predict customer spending and response rates, allowing for better budget allocation and campaign targeting.

🎯 2. Business Problem
Companies spend millions on marketing campaigns, yet many campaigns fail due to inefficient targeting. This project aims to:
✅ Predict customer spending based on past behavior.
✅ Identify customers most likely to respond to a campaign.
✅ Optimize ad spend allocation across different channels.

📌 Key Questions:

How much will a customer likely spend after seeing a campaign?
Which customers are most likely to engage with a campaign?
What-if we adjusted marketing spend? How would it impact response rates?
📊 3. Data Overview
✅ Source: Marketing campaign performance dataset (BigQuery)
✅ Size: 2,240 rows x 29 columns
✅ Key Variables:

Demographics: Age, Income, Family Size
Customer Behavior: Purchase history, web interactions
Marketing Performance: Ad spend, campaign responses
📌 Feature Engineering Includes:
✅ Customer engagement rate
✅ Total spending across channels
✅ Time since first purchase

🔍 4. Machine Learning Approach
📌 Predictive Modeling Tasks
1️⃣ Regression Task: Predict Total Spending ($) per customer

Target: Total_Spending
Model Used: XGBoost Regressor
2️⃣ Classification Task: Predict Campaign Response (Yes/No)

Target: Response (0/1)
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
📌 Preprocessing Steps:
✅ Handle missing values in Income.
✅ Encode categorical variables (Education, Marital_Status).
✅ Scale numerical variables where necessary.

🛠️ 5. Tech Stack
✅ Programming Languages: Python, SQL
✅ Cloud Platform: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)
✅ ML Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
✅ Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit

📈 6. Model Evaluation & Metrics
📌 Regression Model (Spending Prediction)
✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE) → Measures prediction accuracy.
✅ R-Squared Score (R²) → Explains variance explained by the model.

📌 Classification Model (Response Prediction)
✅ Accuracy Score → Measures overall correctness.
✅ Precision & Recall → Important for detecting engaged customers.

📌 Explainability: Using SHAP (SHapley Values) to understand model predictions.

🎭 7. Scenario Analysis & Deployment
📌 What-If Analysis (Campaign Budget Scenarios)
✅ Scenario A: Increase social media spend by 20% 🚀
✅ Scenario B: Reduce spending on low-performing ads 📉
✅ Scenario C: Shift budget to most engaged customer segments 🎯

📌 Deployment Plan
✅ Model & API: FastAPI / Flask
✅ Dashboard: Tableau / Power BI / Streamlit
✅ Cloud Deployment: GCP App Engine

💡 8. Expected Outcomes & Impact
📌 For Business Decision-Makers:
✅ Improved ROI on marketing spend (15-30% higher conversion rates).
✅ Identify high-value customers for better targeting.
✅ Automate campaign analysis for data-driven decision-making.

📌 For Data Science Enthusiasts:
✅ Demonstrates end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
✅ Showcases real-world predictive modeling.
✅ Highlights cloud-based ML deployment.

📁 9. Deliverables
✅ Cleaned Dataset (Stored in BigQuery).
✅ Trained Machine Learning Models (Regression & Classification).
✅ Interactive Dashboard (Tableau / Power BI / Streamlit).
✅ Final Presentation Deck (For stakeholders).
✅ GitHub Repository (Code + Documentation).
